# NFL Quarterback Analysis
### Topic

Analyzing how a select group of NFL quarterbacks perfom in relation to how their offensive line plays

### Motivation

As a New York Giants fan I have watched Eli Manning play for years. 
In recent seasons, both Eli and the offensive line have taken a lot of criticisim for their performance.
I wanted to see how quarterback performance was effected by offensive line play. 
I hypothesized that when QB is sacked/hit more his performance declines.

### Background information

### Summary 

As a lot of people know, there are a variety of factors that contribute to quarterback performance in the NFL. 
Therefore it is difficult to truly determine how stong the causation is between the variables. 
While most of the data varies depending of quarterback, there were two relationships that I thought were interesting. 
Comparing both sacks and hits to completion percentage shows a negative relationship across all qbs. 
These are the only two relationships that are the same across all the quarterbacks.
